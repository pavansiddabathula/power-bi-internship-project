Global Energy Trends: A Comprehensive Analysis of Key Regions and Generation Modes using Power BI

Introduction

Energy plays a vital role in modern life, and its significance is expected to grow with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. While power generation contributes significantly to global CO₂ emissions, it is also a key sector driving the transition towards net-zero emissions by rapidly integrating renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.

This project focuses on analyzing global energy trends, emphasizing sustainability, efficiency, and renewable energy adoption. Using Power BI, this project leverages data analysis techniques to gain insights into energy consumption, generation, and optimization strategies across different regions and industries.

Project Scenarios

Scenario 1: Smart Grid Implementation in Urban Areas
